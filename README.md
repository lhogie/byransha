# byransha
A Simple Graph-Oriented Database for Java


# Configuration

## Development frontend
To run the frontend locally in development mode, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh)

### Install Dependencies
Navigate to the frontend directory located at `~\byransha\src\main\java\frontend` and run the following command:
```bash
bun install
```

### Start the Frontend
First, run `Webserver.java`. Then, in the same frontend directory, execute the following command:
```bash
bun start
```

If successful, you should see an icon in the bottom-right corner of your screen, which can be clicked.
When you make changes to the frontend directory, the server will automatically reload. You can view the updates in your browser without needing to refresh the page.
