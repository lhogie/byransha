# byransha
Byransha aims to explore the relevance of the graph approach in the context of software development. He is particularly interested in the case of web software, for which graphs can be used, at least, for data structuring, persistence, and user interface organization.

The first use case and initial motivation for this project is to provide the I3S laboratory with an HR dashboard. Rather than opting for a classic design around a relational database and a web framework (such as Spring), we chose to explore recent graph-oriented techniques, something we had started in recent projects, notably through the use of Neo4j.

# Configuration

## Development frontend
To run the frontend locally in development mode, ensure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed.

### Install Dependencies
Navigate to the frontend directory  `~\byransha\src\main\java\frontend` and run:
```bash
bun install
```

### First start the backend
Run class `byransha.web.WebServer`.

### Then start the Frontend
In the same frontend directory, execute:
```bash
bun start
```

If successful, you should see an icon in the bottom-right corner of your screen, which can be clicked.
When you make changes to the frontend directory, the server will automatically reload. You can view the updates in your browser without needing to refresh the page.
